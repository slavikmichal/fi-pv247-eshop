**Project description**

For the project assignment we would like to work on an eshop. The purposed functionality follows: 
- show some basic pages (welcome page, about us, contact page, \ldots),
- show products with (for signed in users) and without prices,
- register user with his/her address and contact information,
- provide a simple shopping basket functionality,
- provide checkout with pick up and pay in store options,
- responsive design,
- search in products,
- possible support for more than one language,
- use firebase cloudstore for storing the products (ideally with images).

This eshop could serve as a prototype for a real eshop. In this project we would like to use firebase for handling users and backend database. There is a possiblity in using FinalForm for the user's registration in this eshop. For the UI elements we would like to use MUI library. 

The *main flow* for a user would be: open eshop, log in, browse/search for products, add desired items to the shopping basket, check order and checkout. The application would handle storing the order in the database. As a bonus it would be good, if we have time to handle the order, after it was submitted. This means possibly notifying the shop about this order and also notifing the user about the received order via an email.
